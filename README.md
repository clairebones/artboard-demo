# Sketch Artboard Demo

This project implements a demo of a document and artboard viewer for Sketch Cloud, based on the brief detailed [here](https://github.com/sketch-hq/frontend-code-test).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for convenience given the recommended time constraints of the work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
